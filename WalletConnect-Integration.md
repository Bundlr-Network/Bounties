# WalletConnect Bundlr Integration

## **Introduction**

As of today - you can now store data on Arweave using Matic tokens!

At Bundlr we firmly believe that the future of the new web is cross-chain. We want to help make this a reality, so we’re
rewarding developers like yourself for building out some key infrastructure.

**Time investment:** One weekend.

## **Reward**

**$9000**

Create a library which allows users to interact with Bundlr via WalletConnect (moving funds, withdrawing funds and
uploading data). Along with the library - an interactive web application, that utilises your library which allows you to
store data on Bundlr with MATIC tokens.

## **Resources**

You can find the docs for getting started with Bundlr [here](https://docs.bundlr.network).

You'll also need [arbundles](https://github.com/Bundlr-Network/arbundles) which provides methods needed to create a
Bundlr tx.

## **Rules**

### **Successful submissions will meet the following criteria:**

- Submissions must be **your own original work**, and must be **unique or substantially different** from other
  submissions.
- The library **must** interact with Bundlr via WalletConnect only
- Implementations must be **open source, with the full source code available on Github or another open code hosting
  repository**. Feel free to use whatever OSS licence you prefer.
- Implements
- Your submission must include a link to the library and the live, functioning, and running instance of the app itself,
  as well as a link to the repository it is stored within.
- All applicants must **[join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/xwsTEZv6DU)** and share your submission in the
  bounties channel upon completion
- Your GitHub account **must be at least one month old**

## **Reward details**

  provision of recipients’ ETH and AR addresses.
